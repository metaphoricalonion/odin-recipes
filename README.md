# odin-recipes
This is one of the very first project in the TOP curriculum. The finished product would be a recipe website that has a main page who has links of other pages in the site that has recipes in them. 

**Skills I have demonstrated in this project:**
- Add images to a page
- Link files and pages to each other
- Set up an .html file and the boilerplate code needed
- Add unordered and ordered lists to a page
- Make meaningful and to-the-point commit messages
