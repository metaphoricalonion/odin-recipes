        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I wouldn't describe making homemade croissants as easy since there are multiple steps, and it does take at least half a day. But it's really not that hard either; and certainly simpler than flying to Paris, which is the only other way to enjoy these amazing pastries. This croissant recipe, with a helpful video, was adapted from one by Bruno Albouze, from The Real Deal (which he is).
