        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of sweet potato pie (which I'm not that fond of), I made sweet potato muffins and I was thrilled with the results. Muffin or cupcake? Frosted or unfrosted? Doesn't matter--these really are fantastic. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>non-stick cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups mashed sweet potato (yams)</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped pecans, plus more for topping</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons demerara sugar for topping </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffins tins with paper muffin liners. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, ground ginger, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture gets light and foamy, about 2 minutes. Pour in vegetable oil and melted butter; whisk together thoroughly. Add mashed sweet potatoes and chopped pecans. Add dry ingredients. Whisk together until dry ingredients disappear into the batter, about 1 minutes. Let batter set for 10 minutes before filling muffin cups.</li>
            <li>Fill muffin cups about 3/4 of the way to the top. Sprinkle tops with pecans and a pinch of demerara sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake until a bamboo skewer inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan about 10 minutes; transfer muffins to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
